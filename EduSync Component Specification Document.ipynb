    "\n",
    "**Teacher Dashboard Dependencies:**\n",
    "- **Upstream (Data Sources):**\n",
    "  - Assignment Aggregation Service (provides unified assignment data)\n",
    "  - Platform Adapter Registry (provides connection status)\n",
    "  - Sync Orchestration Service (provides sync timestamps)\n",
    "  - Authentication Service (provides user context)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Downstream (Data Consumers):**\n",
    "  - User interactions trigger API calls to Application Layer\n",
    "  - Filter selections update query parameters\n",
    "  - Navigation events route to other presentation components\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Peer Components:**\n",
    "  - Student Portal (shared data models)\n",
    "  - Settings Console (configuration changes affect dashboard state)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Component Boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Scope:**\n",
    "- Display aggregated assignments from multiple platforms\n",
    "- Filter assignments by date, platform, course, type\n",
    "- Visual indicators for due dates, platforms, submission status\n",
    "- Click-through links to native platform interfaces\n",
    "- Real-time sync status display\n",
    "- Export to calendar functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Out of Scope:**\n",
    "- Assignment creation (handled by native platforms)\n",
    "- Grade entry (handled by native platforms)\n",
    "- Student-facing views (separate component)\n",
    "- Administrative reports (separate component)\n",

    "## 2. Teacher Dashboard Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Purpose Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The Teacher Dashboard component serves as the primary interface for educators to view and manage assignments across multiple ed-tech platforms in a unified timeline view. It eliminates context-switching overhead by aggregating data from Google Classroom, PowerSchool, CodeHS, and other connected platforms into a single, filterable interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 User Stories Addressed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary User Story:**\n",
    "> As a CS teacher managing multiple platforms (AP Students, Google Classroom, CodeHS, PowerSchool), I want to view all upcoming assignments and deadlines from all platforms in a single unified dashboard, so that I can quickly assess workload distribution and identify scheduling conflicts without switching between platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Secondary User Stories:**\n",
    "- Filter assignments by specific date ranges to focus on grading periods\n",
    "- Identify platform-specific assignment clusters to balance workload\n",
    "- Access original platform assignments for editing with single click\n",
    "- Export assignment calendar to Google Calendar for offline reference\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unified Timeline View:** Chronological display of all assignments regardless of source platform\n",
    "2. **Multi-Dimensional Filtering:** Date range, platform, course, assignment type filters\n",
    "3. **Visual Platform Indicators:** Color-coded badges and icons for quick platform identification\n",
    "4. **Due Date Proximity Warnings:** Visual cues for assignments due within 48 hours\n",
    "5. **Connection Status Monitoring:** Real-time display of platform connection health\n",
    "6. **Quick Actions:** Export, refresh, and navigate to platform actions\n",
    "7. **Responsive Design:** Tablet and desktop optimized layout\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Non-Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance:** Dashboard loads within 2 seconds with cached data\n",
    "- **Responsiveness:** Supports viewport widths from 768px to 1920px\n",
    "- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliant (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)\n",
    "- **Browser Support:** Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+\n",
    "- **Data Freshness:** Displays last sync timestamp, maximum staleness 24 hours\n",

    "## 3. Component Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Component Docstring\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Teacher Dashboard Component\n",
    "\n",
    "A React-based presentation component that aggregates and displays assignments\n",
    "from multiple ed-tech platforms in a unified, filterable timeline interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Teacher Dashboard is the primary landing page for educators using EduSync,\n",
    "providing at-a-glance visibility into assignment distribution, due dates, and\n",
    "platform connection status across Google Classroom, PowerSchool, CodeHS, and\n",
    "other integrated platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsibilities:\n",
    "    - Fetch and display aggregated assignment data from API\n",
    "    - Provide interactive filtering controls (date, platform, course, type)\n",
    "    - Render assignment cards with platform-specific styling\n",
    "    - Display sync status and last update timestamps\n",
    "    - Handle user interactions (clicks, filter changes, exports)\n",
    "    - Manage loading states and error conditions\n",
    "    - Navigate to external platform URLs on assignment click\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependencies:\n",
    "    - React 18.x for component lifecycle and hooks\n",
    "    - React Query for data fetching and caching\n",
    "    - TailwindCSS for styling\n",
    "    - date-fns for date manipulation\n",
    "    - lucide-react for iconography\n",
    "    - EduSync API for backend integration\n",
    "\n",
    "State Management:\n",
    "    - Local state: UI filters, selected date range, expanded views\n",
    "    - Remote state: Assignment data (via React Query)\n",
    "    - Context: User authentication, platform connections\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Considerations:\n",
    "    - Uses React Query for automatic caching and background refetching\n",
    "    - Implements virtualization for lists exceeding 50 assignments\n",
    "    - Debounces filter changes to reduce API calls\n",
    "    - Lazy loads assignment detail modals\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessibility:\n",
    "    - Full keyboard navigation support\n",
    "    - ARIA labels for screen readers\n",
    "    - Focus management for modals and filters\n",
    "    - Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Usage:\n",
    "    ```tsx\n",
    "    import TeacherDashboard from '@/components/dashboard/TeacherDashboard';\n",
    "\n",
    "    function App() {\n",
    "        return (\n",
    "            <AuthProvider>\n",
    "                <TeacherDashboard userId=\"teacher_123\" />\n",
    "            </AuthProvider>\n",
    "        );\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
